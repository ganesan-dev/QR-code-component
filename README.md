### Built with

### What I learned

What i learned is about the media queries and how it works for different types of customization

```@media (max-width: 500px) {
      .main{
        margin-top: 50px;
        width: 350px;
        height: 550px;
      }
      .qr-image{
        width: 320px;
        height: 320px;
      }
      .heading{
        font-size: 25px;
      }
      .para{
        font-size: 18px;
      }
      .attribution{
        margin-top: 10px;
      }
}
```
